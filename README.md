This is a small project created as part of the final projects of the Front End Libraries Certification (300 hours) of [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn). 

For this project I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. 

To convert HTML to Markdown, I used Marked / [marked.js](https://marked.js.org/), a Markdown parser and compiler.
